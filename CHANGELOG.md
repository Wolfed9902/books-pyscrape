## (8/27/2020)

Added core functionality for scraping from books.toscrape.com.
Functionality includes scrape functions that can retrieve both book titles and prices from the website, as well as compress the separate ordered lists into a dictionary. As of currently, data is retrieved from the first page of the catalogue.
